# Omniranger

This Project Reads out I2C Rangefinders and sends out MAVLink
Distance Message via Serial Port.
The Sensors are connected via an TCA9548A I2C Multiplexer Board.
We used:
  * 8 GY-US42v2 Sonar Rangefinders
  * 8 TOF10120 Time of Flight Optical Rangefinders
  * 1 TCA9548
  * 1 Arduino Pro Mini

The System was planed for our autonomous Art mediator robot.

This Project is based of [this](https://github.com/patrickpoirier51/TFMINI-POC/blob/master/TFMINI_I2C_MAVLINK/TFMINI_I2C_MAVLINK.ino) sketch from partickporier51
